function indices = listIntersectingElements(obj, polygon)
% listIntersectingElements returns a list of 2-dimensional indices of the
% elements in the array that intersect the given polygon.  
%
%   Note that the intersection may be merely a single point; further
%   evaluations should be done to determine the extent to which each of the
%   listed elements intersect the polygon.  However, this function is
%   useful to limit the number of elements that need to be intersected with
%   each polygon (in case there are millions of elements in the array).  
%
%   INDICES = listIntersectingElements(OBJ, POLYGON)
%
%   OBJ is the RectangularArray object.
%   POLYGON is a Polygon object.  It is assumed to be on the same plane as
%       the RectangularArray OBJ.  To convert the 3D POLYGON coordinates
%       into indices, the POLYGON is projected onto this RectangularArray,
%       discarding the normal component of each point.  
%   INDICES is a NELEMENTS row by 2 column matrix, where the first column
%       represents the horizontal index and the second column represents
%       the vertical index.  Each row reperesents one of the elements that
%       intersects the given polygon.  
%
%   For simplicity, indices may include the indices of some elements that
%   don't intersect the polygon.
%   TODO: Improve the specificity of this function later.

% First get 2D coordinates
vertices3D = polygon.toMatrix();
vertices2D = obj.convertGlobalToArrayCoordinates(vertices3D);

% Then scale & shift so
% - that the interval between each integer value coordinate corresponds to
% a row or column of elements and
% - that the bottom left corner of the array corresponds to (0,0)
vertices2D(:,1) = vertices2D(:,1) ./ obj.element_width;
vertices2D(:,2) = vertices2D(:,2) ./ obj.element_height;

vertices2D(:,1) = vertices2D(:,1) + obj.ncols/2;
vertices2D(:,2) = vertices2D(:,2) + obj.nrows/2;

% For now, stick to Cartesian element indexing since it matches the vertex
% coordinates (i.e., the index equals the floor(coordinate)+1).  
% We can easily convert afterwards.

%% Clip the polygon against the border of the whole array
[vx, vy] = polybool('intersection', vertices2D(:,1), vertices2D(:,2), ...
    [0, 0, obj.ncols, obj.ncols], [0, obj.nrows, obj.nrows, 0]);
% polybool returns a closed polygon (in which the last vertex equals the
% first).

%% Determine the indices
% For now, return all of the indices that fit within the rectangular window
% that bounds the polygon.
x_min = floor(min(vx));
x_max = floor(max(vx));
y_min = floor(min(vy));
y_max = floor(max(vy));

indices_x_values = (x_min:x_max)' + 1;
indices_y_values = obj.nrows - (y_min:y_max)';

[index_x, index_y] = meshgrid(indices_x_values, indices_y_values);

% Here, we have some elements that don't intersect.
% This will cause more computation in the future, but okay for now.
indices = [index_x(:), index_y(:)];
