classdef OrthogonalAxes
    % ORTHOGONALAXES A pair of orthogonal axes on a plane in 3D space.
    %   The axes are internally represented by a pair of orthonormal
    %   vectors. 
    %
    %   Note that to properly validate the axes (and to ensure that they
    %   are orthogonal to each other), the axes are immutable.

        % Since these local axes will likely be defined in a global 3D
        % coordinate space (where the global axes are called x, y, and z),
        % it would be confusing to call the axes x and y here.  
        %
        % Since this class is designed to represent the axes with respect
        % to a plane, call the plane's 2D axes "horizontal" and "vertical".
        % This will help avoid ambiguity or confusion when converting
        % between plane coordinates and row/column indices.  
        %
        % If it helps though, think of horizontal as the local x axis,
        % vertical as the local y axis, and normal() as the local z axis.  
        
        % Both properties are stored as matrices of size [1,3] representing
        % the unit vectors.
